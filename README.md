# CurvesProject

## Overview

CurvesProject is a small C++ solution that demonstrates a **3D curves hierarchy** with a DLL library and a console application.  
It supports three types of 3D geometric curves:

- **Circle** (planar in X-Y plane)
- **Ellipse** (planar in X-Y plane)
- **Helix** (spatial, with radius and step)

Each curve can calculate:

- A 3D point on the curve at parameter `t`
- The first derivative (3D vector) at `t`

The project also includes:

- A **DLL library (`curves`)** implementing the curves and a factory interface  
- A **console application (`app`)** that populates random curves, prints points/derivatives, and demonstrates sorting and filtering operations.

## Repository Structure

- `CurvesProject/`
  - `curves/` (DLL project)
    - `Curve.h`
    - `Circle.h` / `Circle.cpp`
    - `Ellipse.h` / `Ellipse.cpp`
    - `Helix.h` / `Helix.cpp`
    - `CurveFactory.cpp` (factory functions for exported curves)
    - `dllmain.cpp` (auto-generated by VS)
  - `app/` (Console application)
    - `main.cpp`

- The `curves` DLL project contains the core curve classes and exports symbols for use in the app.  
- The `app` project depends on the `curves` DLL to run.

## Requirements

- **Windows 64-bit** (tested in Visual Studio 2022)  
- **C++11 or higher**

## Build Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ikm4rkov/CurvesProject.git
cd CurvesProject
```
2. Open the solution CurvesProject.sln in Visual Studio.

3. Build the solution:
* Make sure the curves DLL project is built first (Visual Studio handles dependencies automatically).
* curves.dll and curves.lib will be copied automatically to the app project output folder (x64\Debug\ or x64\Release\).

4. Run the console app:
* Set app as the startup project.
* Press Ctrl+F5 (Run without debugging) or F5 (Run with debugging).

## Usage
* The app populates a container of random curves (Circle, Ellipse, Helix).
* Prints points and derivatives of all curves at t = π/4.
* Filters only circles into a second container.
* Sorts circles by radius and computes the total sum of radii.

## Notes
* No manual memory management is required; the project uses smart pointers.
* The repository includes a .gitignore for Visual Studio / C++ projects to ignore build artifacts (.exe, .dll, .lib, .obj, etc.).
